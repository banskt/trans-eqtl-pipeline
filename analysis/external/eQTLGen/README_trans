Additional information
----------------------
These files contain all trans-eQTL results from eQTLGen, accompanying the article.
19,960 genes that showed expression in blood were tested.
10,317 trait-associated SNPs (based on GWAS Catalog, Immunobase and Astle et al. study, see Online Methods) were tested.
Every SNP-gene combination with a distance >5Mb and tested in at least 2 cohorts was included.

FDR calculation
---------------
To determine nominal P-value threshold corresponding to FDR=0.05, we used a pruned set of SNPs for trans-eQTL mapping and permutation-based FDR calculation (See Methods).

Crossmapping filter
-------------------
Some trans-eQTL are artefacts resulting from genes that map (partially) to a location nearby the eQTL SNP, effectively represting a cis-eQTL effect.
These potential artefacts were identified by mapping trans-eQTL gene sequences to the immediate surroundings of the SNP (Supplementary Note).
If there was strong evidence that the trans-eQTL was a cross-mapping artefact, it was removed from the list of significant trans-eQTLs.
After filtering, the FDR was re-calculated on the remaining effects.

PLEASE NOTE: the full results file have not been filtered for cross-mapping effects.
The file may include artefacts resulting from genes that map (partially) to a location nearby the eQTL SNP, effectively representing a cis-eQTL effect.


Updates

We have updated the trans-eQTL files:
The current version includes Bonferroni-adjusted p-values
